<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The concept is simple. I like system monitors in Rainmeter. I have a large 21:9 monitor so I can spare a little screenspace at the top of my display. So I wanted reasonably feature rich system monitors that occupied a small amount of vertical space but could use as much horizontal space as needed.

### Built With

* [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

* Download Rainmeter from [https://www.rainmeter.net/](https://www.rainmeter.net/)
* Download the skins from [my S3 bucket](https://entropybit.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/clean+text+and+graphs_1.0.rmskin)

### Installation
* Install Rainmeter, [following the excellent documentation if you need it](https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual/installing-rainmeter/)
* Navigate to the place you saved ``clean+text+and+graphs_1.0.rmskin`` and doubleclick on it. That will open the Rainmeter skins window and all you to open the skins you want to use.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
<!--## Usage

Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

* I'd love to add a weather widget but everytime I do the APIs change and I haven't found one that seems stable.
* I did have an GPU skin using the Afterburner plugin but I found it unreliable in that it didn't work on every system. I now think using Afterburner and RivaTunerStatisticsServer to get an in-game overlay is a better solution to monitoring GPU metrics.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/grjsmith/dotfiles/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
